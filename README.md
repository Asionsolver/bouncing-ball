#Interactive Bouncing Ball Simulation
This project is a physics-based interactive simulation featuring a bouncing ball on a blank canvas. Key features include:

- Launch Mechanics: Click to launch the ball towards the clicked position.
- Realistic Physics: The ball bounces off canvas boundaries, slows down due to friction, and eventually stops.
- Elastic Collisions: Simulates boundary interactions with angle-based directional movement.
- Friction Dynamics: Gradual speed reduction until the ball comes to rest, reactivating the launch instructions.
- Built without any physics or animation libraries, this project showcases physics simulation principles and smooth animations using pure JavaScript and CSS(with optional Tailwind styling).
